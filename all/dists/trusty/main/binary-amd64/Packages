Description: Open Source, Distributed, RESTful Search Engine
 Elasticsearch is a distributed RESTful search engine built for the cloud. 
 .
 Features include:
 .
 + Distributed and Highly Available Search Engine.
  - Each index is fully sharded with a configurable number of shards.
  - Each shard can have one or more replicas.
  - Read / Search operations performed on either one of the replica shard.
 + Multi Tenant with Multi Types.
  - Support for more than one index.
  - Support for more than one type per index.
  - Index level configuration (number of shards, index storage, ...).
 + Various set of APIs
  - HTTP RESTful API
  - Native Java API.
  - All APIs perform automatic node operation rerouting.
 + Document oriented
  - No need for upfront schema definition.
  - Schema can be defined per type for customization of the indexing process.
 + Reliable, Asynchronous Write Behind for long term persistency.
 + (Near) Real Time Search.
 + Built on top of Lucene
  - Each shard is a fully functional Lucene index
  - All the power of Lucene easily exposed through simple 
    configuration/plugins.
 + Per operation consistency
  - Single document level operations are atomic, consistent, isolated and
    durable.
 + Open Source under Apache 2 License.
